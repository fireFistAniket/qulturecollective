        KaiB was amazing with our cats!! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ This was our first time using a
        pet-sitting service, so we were naturally quite anxious. We took a
        chance on Kai and completely lucked out! We booked Kai to come twice a
        day for three days. Kai spent a considerable amount of time playing and
        engaging with our cats. She also sent us very funny and detailed reports
        at the end of each session. She truly gave us peace of mind while on
        holiday, knowing our furbabies were in good hands. We also kept looking
        forward to her cute updates! You can tell she&apos;s a natural with
        animals. I&apos;d definitely book her again. Highly recommended!{" "}
